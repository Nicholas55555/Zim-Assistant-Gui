# Zim-Assistant Gui
Multi-platform easy-to-use assistant for working with Zim files. Can be used to create Zim files, extract full or selected content of Zim files (using Zimply), Get titles/urls in Zim files and view content of Zim files. Works on Windows, macOS and Linux. 

I created this application to make it easier to collect data from the internet for running a local AI on my machine.
