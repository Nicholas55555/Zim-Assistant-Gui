# Zim-Assistant Gui
Multi-platform easy-to-use assistant for working with Zim files. Can be used to create Zim files, extract content of Zim files (using Zimply), and view content of Zim files and works on Windows, macOS and Linux. 

I created this application to make it easier to collect data from the internet for running a local AI on my machine.
